== Introduction.

Although the following Memoranda of our beloved mother have appeared in print,
we have desired to see them in a more convenient and accessible form.
In reprinting them, some revision has been made,
and a portion of the comments of the former compiler has been retained.

The annexed record of her religious exercises shows
her faithful and patient walk through life;
and though penned, we believe,
without expectation of its meeting other eyes than those of her children,
we hope may animate and encourage survivors to press onward in the christian warfare,
so that at the closing moments of time, they may be favored, as she was,
with a holy hope of admission into the assembly of the just of all generations.
